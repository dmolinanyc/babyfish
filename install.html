How I installed BabyFish guess game on AWS

# The permissions could be better handled.

1) start AWS ubuntu instance

1a) sudo apt-get update

2) sudo apt-get install nginx nodejs npm

3) npm install ws, requirejs

4) modify guess_game_ui.js path:

  var gamesocket = new WebSocket("ws://YOURIP_OR_WEHADDRESS_HERE:8080");

5) opened screen and ran 'nodejs node_server.js'

6) started nginx replaced the default root folder config with guess_game  

Future Plans to BabyFish

BabyFish is a guessgame.  The game is now only a guess game of 1-20, but the plan is to expand it into an actual fishing game, in which one would cast their line out into the pond and if a fish is there at a given time, you might get a nibble or catch the fish.  The fish will also change in age, from babies to full grown.  If too small, the fish will be thrown back into the pond.

Plan is to implement a backbone or angularjs for the gui.  Wth Bootstrap, this app should also behave responsively and should be able to work on tablet and mobile.  More to come soon.
